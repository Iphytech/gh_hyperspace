As a student, you can apply for the Student Developer Pack, which offers a free subscription to various developer tools and a free Developer plan with unlimited private repositories for your personal user account.
> There’s no substitute for hands-on experience, but for most students, real world tools can be cost prohibitive. That’s why we created the GitHub Student Developer Pack with some of our partners and friends: to give students free access to the best developer tools in one place so they can learn by doing.

Here is a list of some of the free services included:

Atom
Bitnami
Crowdflower
DigitalOcean
DNSimple
GitHub
HackHands
Namecheap
Orchestrate
Screenhero
SendGrid
Stripe
Travis CI
Unreal Engine
