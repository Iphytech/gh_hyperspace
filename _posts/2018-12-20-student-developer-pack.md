As a student, you can apply for the Student Developer Pack, which offers a free subscription to various developer tools and a free Developer plan with unlimited private repositories for your personal user account.
> There’s no substitute for hands-on experience, but for most students, real world tools can be cost prohibitive. That’s why we created the GitHub Student Developer Pack with some of our partners and friends: to give students free access to the best developer tools in one place so they can learn by doing.

Requirements

To be eligible for a Student Developer Pack, you must:

* Be currently enrolled in a degree or diploma granting course of study
* Have a verifiable school-issued email address or share documents that prove your current student status
* Have a GitHub user account
* Be at least 13 years old
